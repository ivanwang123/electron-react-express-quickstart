# Getting Started with Electron + React + Express Quickstart

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm run electron-dev`

Runs the app in the development mode with electron, react (port 3000), and express (default port 5010).

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.

### `npm run electron-build`

Copies electron and express server files to the `build` folder.

### `npm run dist`

Creates a distribution .exe application to the `dist` folder.
